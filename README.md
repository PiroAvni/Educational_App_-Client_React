## Miro

We used miro to contribute and share their ideas for the application's features. The platform enables real-time collaboration, allowing  us to add sticky notes, drawings, and other visual elements to express their ideas. This dynamic and interactive environment fosters creativity and encourages the free flow of thoughts and suggestions.

## Trello

we tracked tasks, assigned responsibilities, and monitored progress. We organised the development workflow using Trello boards, where tasks are categorized into lists such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed." This provides transparency and clarity on the status of different project elements, facilitating efficient task management.
